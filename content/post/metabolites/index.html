title: An overview - Plants, biotechnology and metabolites 
---



<p>Plants have been used as a source of traditional medicine for decades (Fennell et al., 2004). The authors (Fennell et al., 2004) mention the important uses of plant compounds, they include antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antifungal, antischistosomal, anthelminthic, antimalarial and anti-amoebic (Fennell et al., 2004). However, with the increased uses of plants, new methodology is needed to make the extraction and purification of compounds from plants easier and to produce higher quantities of the compounds, often for commercial purposes, this is often done by in vitro methods (Bourgaud et al., 2001). Extracting material from plants has become easier with the use modern technologies, however, there have been very few successful productions of valuable secondary metabolites (Bourgaud et al., 2001).</p>
<p>Biotechnology is known to be one of the greatest benefits to humankind (Boulter, 1995). Humans have manipulated living organisms for decades. Some of the earliest types of biotechnology included agriculture, beer and the making of bread (Boulter, 1995). Since then, technology has improved greatly; humans have managed to introduce desirable traits into organisms through genetic modification and engineering, especially in plants, this is referred to as plant biotechnology (Boulter, 1995; Bourgaud et al., 2001), another well-used technique is tissue culture.</p>
<p>Metabolites play an important role in the metabolism, which carries out important biochemical reactions (Hussain et al., 2012), and are found in all kingdoms. The metabolites that are found in plants are categorized into two categories, namely primary metabolites and secondary metabolites (MacQueen, 1988; Hussain et al., 2012). Primary metabolites are important for a plantâ€™s development and growth whilst secondary metabolites do not play an important role in the growth and development of the plant but may be vital for the overall survival of the plant (Hussain et al., 2012). The absence of secondary metabolites may not affect the plant in the short-term, however, it may affect the long-term survival of the plant (Hussain et al., 2012). Add more references.</p>
