title: A closer look at secondary metabolites
---

Whilst primary metabolites include only a small range of compounds (proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids), secondary metabolites entail a wide range of compounds (alkaloids, steroids, flavonoids, tannins, phenolics etcetera) (Class notes, Prof Finnie, 2019). Most secondary metabolite compounds are produced by plants as a defence mechanism, protecting themselves against toxins and pathogens in their surroundings (Bourgaud et al., 2001). Some compounds in this group are have the ability to protect plants against harmful ultra violet rays whilst others release toxins that deter herbivorous insects and animals (Bourgaud et al., 2001).  

For centuries, these compounds have played an important role in traditional medicines, their discovery is often due to their high toxicity levels, which increase the visibility of effectiveness (may show effects in only a few hours) (Bourgaud et al., 2001) (Class notes, Prof Finnie, 2019). Secondary metabolites are considered economically important for the use of drugs, flavours, fragrances, insecticides, and dyes (Pagare et al., 2015).  For example, a diterpene alkaloid, Taxol (paclitaxel), is found in the bark of Taxus trees and is known for its anticancer effects (Hussain et al., 2012).  

These compounds are very specific as they usually only occur in specific localities in plants and are not widely distributed among taxa or species (Hussain et al., 2012). They usually accumulate in small quantities and are therefore difficult to extract and purify, which is among the main reasons for their high economic value (Bourgaud et al., 2001).
