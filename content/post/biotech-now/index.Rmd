title: How much has biotechnology evolved since the 1980s?  
---
The difficulty with extraction and purification of secondary metabolites is that it is 1) difficult 2) costly and 3) time consuming. MacQueen (1988) highlighted some problems with the extraction of secondary metabolites and many of those difficulties are still problematic today.   

### Current technologies include:  

Biopharming or plant molecular farming is to genetically modify plants for the manufacturing of various pharmaceuticals and industrial products. For example, genetically modifying tobacco with desired therapeutic proteins could lead to the manufacturing of vaccines and antibodies to treat life-long diseases such as cancer. The products produced by such methods are referred to as ‘biopharmaceuticals’ or ‘biologics’.

### Another solution may be the use of in vitro methods  

Cell suspension culture
This method submerges plant cells in a liquid, the cells in the culture will multiply.
