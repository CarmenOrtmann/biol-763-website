<p>The struggle with extraction and purification of secondary metabolites is that it is 1) difficult 2) costly and 3) time consuming (Class notes, Prof Finnie, 2019). Third world countries are often not politically or economically stable and so expensive techniques are not easily available to these nations. MacQueen (1988) highlighted some difficulties with the extraction of secondary metabolites and many of those difficulties are still problematic today (Class notes, Prof Finnie, 2019). In addition, the size of natural habitats are decreasing because of anthropical activities which cause global changes (Lewis and Maslin, 2015; Isbell et al., 2017). This causes plants which have specific distribution localities to become extinct (Hussain et al., 2012). Therefore, relying on the plants occurring in natural habitats may not be realistic for the large amounts of produce that is required. Some alternatives or solutions for this increased demand include biopharming and <em>in vitro</em> methods.</p>

<h3>Biopharming or plant molecular farming (PMF)</h3>
<p>This process genetically modifies plants for the manufacturing of various pharmaceuticals and industrial products (Elbehri, 2005). For example, genetically modifying tobacco or corn with desired therapeutic proteins could produce vaccines, drugs and antibodies for treating life-long diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases (Elbehri, 2005). The products produced by such methods are referred to as ‘biopharmaceuticals’ or ‘biologics’ (Elbehri, 2005).</p>
<p>The use of biopharming could be seen as an alternative to current methods or as an implementation in response to the increased demands from the growing human population (Elbehri, 2005; Yadav, 2010). However, this concept has not yet been fully accepted, A <a href="http://www.pub.ac.za/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Factsheet-Pub-BioPharming2PRINT3.pdf">Public Understanding of Biotechnology factsheet</a> addresses some of the concerns, whilst highlighting the advantages that this implementation could bring about. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advantages</strong>
<ul>
<li>The possibility of large scale productions.<br />
</li>
<li>Lowered production costs as current technology includes costly machinery and techniques.</li>
<li>The use of plants may include the possibility to produce more complex drugs, especially when compared to those produced in genetically modified animals.<br />
</li>
<li>This may be a safer vaccine and antigen production.</li>
<li>A helpful way to increase the availability of vaccines and treatment to third world countries.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Disadvantages</strong>
<ul>
<li>Contamination of the food chain.</li>
<li>Allergic reactions to the products produced.<br />
</li>
<li>Negative impacts on non-target organisms (for example, grazers).<br />
</li>
<li>Workers may be exposed to health risks if exposed to the plants for prolonged periods.<br />
</li>
<li>Plant dosages may need quality control.<br />
</li>
<li>Chemicals used to treat the crops may have unexpected outcomes on the final product.</li>

<h3><em>In vitro</em> methods</h3>
<p>An alternative solution to chemical synthesis and whole plant based extraction may be the use of sterile environment <em>in vitro</em> methods. Such methods do not take place inside an organism but rather in a test tube or culture plate. Tissue culture (a process established in the 1960’s) is currently one of the successful methods for extrating secondary metabolites (Tiwari and Rana, 2015). However, even with increased focus on improving biotechnological techniques over the past 30 – 40 years, this method is not perfect (Tiwari and Rana, 2015). An especially difficult aspect in tissue culture is the limited nature and specificity of the secondary metabolites in plants (MacQueen, 1988). Plants often produce secondary metabolites in response to environmental stressors such as pathgens but encourntereing these is very unlikely in sterile environments (Class notes, Prof Finnie, 2019). However, this problem may be solved with the introduction of elicitors (which deceive plants by mimicking the attack of a pathogen or fungus which in turn triggers the production of secondary metabolites), signal compounds, and biotic stresses (MacQueen, 1988; Tiwari and Rana, 2015). Another complexity of using cultures is to find the optimum media, the correct explant (the parent plant which the culture is grown from), and culture conditions such as temperature, pH, oxygen, and chemical precursors, to promote optimum culture growth (Class notes, Prof Finnie, 2019).</p>
<p>Despite all this, the benefits of tissue culture include 1) a controlled environment with no competition, 2) limited contamination from microbes and insects, 3) increased potential for any type of plant cell division which promotes the possibility of specific metabolite extraction, 4) an increased overall productivity and decreased labour costs and 5) callus cultures allow for extraction of organic compounds (Tiwari and Rana, 2015; Class notes, Prof Finnie, 2019).</p>

<p>Hairy root cultures are a type of tissue culture that can also be used to produce secondary metabolites through genetic engineering. <em>Rhizobium rhizogenes</em> is a bacterium that occurs in soils and has root-inducing (Ri) plasmids (Pistelli et al., 2010). These plasmids alter root growth causing roots to grow irregularly, making it easier to harvest compounds from them (Pistelli et al., 2010). This method has high genetic stability and productivity and is therefore considered useful (Pistelli et al., 2010).</p>
