title: Are secondary metabolites less important?
---



<p>Secondary metabolites were first distinguished from primary metabolites by Kossel (Bourgaud et al., 2001). The traditional name “secondary metabolites” has existed for decades, but this term may give the impression that these chemicals are of less importance than primary metabolites (Price-Whelan et al., 2006). This is not the case. For example, secondary metabolites used for pollination purposes may not be needed initially, however, once the plant reaches maturity and cannot reproduce asexually the plant relies on these chemicals to attract pollinators to facilitate sexual reproduction (Campbell et al., 2016). To illustrate an example of volatile (chemical pheremones released by plants to attract specific types of pollinators) importance in pollination biology, Campbell et al. (2016) used two <em>Zaluzianskya</em> flower species. These were pollinated by flies and hawkmoths and have overlapping flower opening times. In this experiment, they found a distinct attraction by hawkmoths to one species over the other due to the combination of flower scent and flower orientation (Campbell et al., 2016).</p>

<p>The definition of a secondary metabolite is vague and somewhat confusing. This has stirred a debate on the naming of these compounds (Price-Whelan et al., 2006). However, the compounds found within this group have such a wide range categorized by</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Their chemical structure (most of which have rings which contain a sugar)<br />
</li>
<li>Their composition of nitrogen<br />
</li>
<li>Their solubility<br />
</li>
<li>The pathway that is used to produce them (for example, tannins are produced by the phenylpropanoid pathway) (Tiwari and Rana, 2015)</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to these shared characteristics, these compounds are rare and specific making it difficult to classify all chemicals within secondary metabolite groups (Class notes, Prof Finnie, 2019). Given these shared characteristics, three main groups can be identified: alkaloids, phenolics, and steroids and terpenes (Tiwari and Rana, 2015).</p>
<p>In my opinion, ‘secondary metabolites’ have been given a term that is too broad. This is likely because of their often very similar chemical and molecular structure. Therefore, it might be useful to split these compounds into more than one term. One possibility is to group these compounds based on the kind of function they provide to the plant. These categories may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Defence compounds
<ul>
<li>chemical<br />
</li>
<li>physical<br />
</li>
<li>repair<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Stress tolerance compounds<br />
</li>
<li>Pollination pheromone compounds<br />
</li>
<li>And supplementary compounds (which may include compounds with unclear or unknown functions)</li>
</ul>
<p>A possible alternative to the current terminology would therefore be to change the term secondary metabolites to <strong>functional metabolites</strong> whilst retaining the term ‘primary metabolites’.</p>
