title: Examples of the uses of secondary metabolites
---

### Although plants may survive without the use of secondary metabolites. The extracts of these compounds have great advantages:    

### For example  

 
*Shikonine* is a red pigment that is manufactured by *Lithospermum eryrorhizon* cells which has been used for cosmetics such as lipsticks.  

*Vincristine* is manufactured by *Vinca rosea* and is helpful for treating cancer.   


Other compounds which used to treat cardiovascular disorders include *Digoxin* compounds.  

And *Pyrithrin* is a compound used as an insecticide.
