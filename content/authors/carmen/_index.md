### Biotechnology and secondary metabolites in the 1980s  

 
The paper, “Biotechnology puts the squeeze on plants” by Hilary MacQueen indicates the extent to which biotechnology has advanced over the last few decades. MacQueen (1988) outlines some of the first biotechnological techniques that were used to extract useful substances from plant cells, whilst highlighting some of the problems that biotechnologists came across in that decade. Some of these problems included 1) plants needing precise concentrations of a combination of conditions such as light, temperature, hormones etcetera, 2) for cellular conditions to take place, cells needed to be stirred and this would often lead to damaged or clumped cells, hence the desired product would either be high or low, 3) the desired products are also not always produced, or if the desired product has high toxicity, cells need to be treated with more care to ensure that they are not killed or that they do not produce low yields, 4) there were difficulties in producing primary and secondary metabolites as a precise stage would be needed for either of them  (MacQueen, 1988). The complexity of metabolic pathways in plant cells makes it difficult to extract and purify cells, often chemical extraction is often just luck, which is the case for the historically important pigment, Shikonin (MacQueen, 1988).   

One of the greatest success stories of plant biotechnology, involves the extracting of a red pigment called Shikonin (MacQueen, 1988). Kanebo is a Japanese company which uses Shikonin in multiple lipsticks (MacQueen, 1988), however, the question is, will cosmetics be the only product to be produced by the extraction of secondary metabolites using biotechnology? The latter will build onto the ideas of this paper.
