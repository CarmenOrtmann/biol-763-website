In conclusion, the extraction of secondary metabolites has advanced since the 1980s and technology has helped us to develop more than just cosmetics. However, technology must keep evolving to better this process and help with the extraction of these limiting but highly important economic resources. South Africa has a high biodiversity and is a leading example of the positive influences of biotechnology for the people and the economy, however, often there is a lack of funds to support the costly technology involved in plant biotechnology processes (Nigro et al., 2004).
