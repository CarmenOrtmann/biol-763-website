title: A closer look at secondary metabolites
---

Secondary metabolites manufactured in the secondary metabolism of plants provide many health and economic benefits to humans (Tiwari and Rana, 2015). Primary metabolites include a narrow range of compounds (proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids), whilst secondary metabolites entail a wider range of compounds (alkaloids, steroids, flavonoids, tannins, phenolics, etc.) (Class notes, Prof Finnie, 2019). Most of these secondary metabolite compounds are produced by plants as a defence mechanism against toxins and pathogens from their surrounding environment (Bourgaud et al., 2001). According to Tiwari and Rana (2015), the quantity of secondary metabolites produced from mature plants (which have differentiated tissues) *in vitro* have shown to be significantly more than immature plants(which have non-differentiated tissues).

For centuries, these compounds have played an important role in traditional medicines, however, their discoveries have often been linked to their high toxicity levels (Bourgaud et al., 2001). Toxic plants applied medically often work more quickly and their benefits are therefore seen more rapidly than those of non-toxic plants (Bourgaud et al., 2001; Class notes, Prof Finnie, 2019). Secondary metabolites are economically important for the synthesis of drugs, flavourants, fragrances, insecticides, and dyes (Pagare et al., 2015; Tiwari and Rana, 2015). For example, a diterpene alkaloid, Taxol (paclitaxel), is found in the bark of *Taxus* trees and is known for its anticancer effects (Hussain et al., 2012). These compounds are very specific as they usually only occur in specific areas within plants (Bourgaud et al., 2001; Hussain et al., 2012). In addition, secondary metabolites are sometimes unique to specific species or taxon groups (Hussain et al., 2012). These compounds generally accumulate in small quantities and are therefore difficult to extract and purify (Bourgaud et al., 2001). This is one of the main reasons why the commercial products produced by these compounds are often very expensive.
