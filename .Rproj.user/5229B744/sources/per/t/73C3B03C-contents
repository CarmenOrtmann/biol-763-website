In conclusion, it is evident that even with the advancements in biotechnology, the process of extracting secondary metabolites from plants in both *vitro* and *in vitro* conditions is difficult, expensive and time consuming (Class notes, Prof Finnie, 2019). However, due to increased research and advancements in biotechnology, it has been discovered that the extraction of secondary metabolites serves more than simply cosmetic products (Hussain et al., 2012). Although progress has been slow, there is great potential for this field as the products produced by secondary metabolites will benefit human health and economies greatly (Hussain et al., 2012). Understanding the processes involved in the complex biosynthetic pathways is still a gap and needs to be filled (MacQueen, 1988; Tiwari and Rana, 2015).  

South Africa is a highly biodiverse developing country, however, it is also a leading example of the positive impacts which biotechnology can have on the people and the economy (Nigro et al., 2004). Some areas may lack funds to support the costly technology involved in modern plant biotechnology. Therefore, research of alternative methods should be encouraged further to find more cost-efficient solutions in economically poor areas.
