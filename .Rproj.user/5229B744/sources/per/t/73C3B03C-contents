In conclusion, it is evident that even with the advancements in biotechnology, the process of extracting secondary metabolites from plants in both *vitro* and *in vitro* conditions is difficult, expensive and time consuming. However, due to increased research and advancements in biotechnology, it has been discovered that the extraction of secondary metabolites serves more than simply cosmetic products (Hussain et al., 2012). Although progress has been slow, there is great potential for this field as the products produced by secondary metabolites will benefit human health and economies greatly. Understanding the processes involved in the complex biosynthetic pathways is still a gap and needs to be filled (Tiwari and Rana, 2015).  

South Africa, a developing nations, is a highly biodiverse country. It is also a leading example of the positive impacts which biotechnology can have on the people and the economy. However, there is often a lack of funds to support the costly technology involved in plant biotechnology processes. Therefore alternative methods such as biopharming should be considered for the future (Nigro et al., 2004).
