      <description>Biotechnology and secondary metabolites in the 1980s The paper, “Biotechnology puts the squeeze on plants” by Hilary MacQueen indicates the extent to which biotechnology has advanced over the last few decades. MacQueen (1988) outlines some of the first biotechnological techniques that were used to extract useful substances from plant cells, whilst highlighting some of the problems that biotechnologists came across in that decade. Some of these problems included 1) plants needing precise concentrations of a combination of conditions such as light, temperature, hormones etcetera, 2) for cellular conditions to take place, cells needed to be stirred and this would often lead to damaged or clumped cells, hence the desired product would either be high or low, 3) the desired products are also not always produced, or if the desired product has high toxicity, cells need to be treated with more care to ensure that they are not killed or that they do not produce low yields, 4) there were difficulties in producing primary and secondary metabolites as a precise stage would be needed for either of them (MacQueen, 1988).</description>
