      <description>Plants have been used as a source of traditional medicine for decades (Fennell et al., 2004). Most plants, especially medicinal plants have antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antifungal, antischistosomal, anthelminthic, antimalarial and anti-amoebic properties (Fennell et al., 2004). However, purification and extraction processes differ between compounds with technological improvements being needed for more complex compounds. Plant compound extraction is mostly for commercial purposes, for example in vitro methods may be used to produce large quantities to meet product demands (Bourgaud et al.</description>

      <description>Secondary metabolites were first distinguished from primary metabolites by Kossel (Bourgaud et al., 2001). The traditional name “secondary metabolites” has existed for decades, but this term may give the impression that these chemicals are of less importance than primary metabolites (Price-Whelan et al., 2006). This is not the case. For example, secondary metabolites used for pollination purposes may not be needed initially, however, once the plant reaches maturity and cannot reproduce asexually the plant relies on these chemicals to attract pollinators to facilitate sexual reproduction (Campbell et al.</description>
