Current technologies include:Biopharming or plant molecular farming is to genetically modify plants for the manufacturing of various pharmaceuticals and industrial products. For example, genetically modifying tobacco with desired therapeutic proteins could lead to the manufacturing of vaccines and antibodies to treat life-long diseases such as cancer.</description>
