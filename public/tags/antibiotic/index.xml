      <description>Secondary metabolites were first distinguished from primary metabolites by Kossel (Bourgaud et al., 2001). However, although the traditional name “secondary metabolites” has existed for decades name, this name may give the impression that these chemicals are of less importance than primary metabolites. This is not always the case, for example, if a secondary metabolite is used for pollination purposes, the plant may only need the chemical as a mature plant but if the plant cannot produce by asexual means, it would need such chemicals to further its population.</description>
